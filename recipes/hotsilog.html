    <p>Hotsilog is a meal composed of hotdogs, garlic fried rice, and fried egg. In a Filipino household, this is commonly eaten for breakfast with a condiment of banana ketchup and some pickled shredded papaya (atchara) on the side.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pieces red hotdogs</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup garlic fried rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour water in a small cooking pot. Let boil.</li>
        <li>Add hotdogs and then pour 2 tablespoons cooking oil. Continue to cook until the water evaporates.</li>
        <li>Once the water is gone, fry the hotdogs in the remaining oil for 1 to 2 minutes while slowly rolling it back and forth to prevent it from getting burnt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the eggs by heating 4 tablespoons of cooking oil in a pan.</li>
        <li>Once the oil gets hot, crack a piece of egg and start to fry it. As the egg is frying, grab a spoon and scoop the oil from the bottom of the pot. Pour the oil over the egg. Do this until the yolk gets a white covering. Remove the egg and set aside. Do the same step on the other piece of egg.</li>
        <li>Serve with ketchup. Share and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
